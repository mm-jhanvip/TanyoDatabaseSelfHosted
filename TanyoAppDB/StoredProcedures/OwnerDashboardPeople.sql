-- SP Name   : OwnerDashboardPeople
-- Module    : Owner Dashboard - People ("Is My Team Productive?")
-- Params    : @TenantId INT, @Month INT, @Year INT
-- Returns   : One row per sales rep: target, achievement, orders, collection,
--             conversion, attendance % and pending follow-ups.
--
-- KPI Logic:
--   Rep universe  = Active tenant users who are NOT manufacturing roles
--                   (Contractor/StoreManager/Supervisor role names excluded,
--                   mirroring UserBL.salesmandropdown()).
--   MonthlyTarget = SalesTargets row for rep + month (0 when unset).
--   Achieved      = SUM(AmountBeforeGST) of approved orders (period).
--   Collection    = SUM(approved Payments) on that rep's orders (MTD).
--   LeadConversion= Rep approved orders / rep new leads * 100.
--   AttendancePct = Distinct punch-in days / working days elapsed so far
--                   (full month when viewing a past month), capped at 100.
--   PendingFollowUps = Open leads of the rep with a follow-up due on/before
--                      today (lead status not Disqualified/Closed/Deleted).
