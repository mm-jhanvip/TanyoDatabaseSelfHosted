--               DailyAchieved       approved order value that day (pre-GST)
--               CumulativeAchieved  running total through that day
--               DailyTarget         monthly rep target / days in month
-- Notes     : Cumulative uses a window function (SQL 2012+).
--             Chart plots target (dashed, full month) vs achieved (solid).
